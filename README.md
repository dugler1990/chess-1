# chess
chess made with pygame

This is unfinished. I am still working on it. None of the pieces can move, but the pawns highlight the spaces they can move to when clicked on. There is no way to de-select a piece after clicking.

The pieces can be selected and deselected. They can move now, but only the pawns have a way to find new spaces, and they move off the board.
